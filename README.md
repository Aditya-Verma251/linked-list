me failing to make a linked list in c.

## to run:
use make to run the makefile, then use "./demo" to run the demo program

## debug:
run ```make debug``` to make a debug file and then use a debugger like gdb

## how to use:
add ```#include "linkedlist.h"``` to your c file and then use the makefile already provided or make your own (recommended).

## final note:
okeyy byee~
